My story is about a candy shop worker named Henry that has to restock inventory. He can only have 60 pieces of candy
 on the shelf he is restocking. He has to check the inventory on Jolly Ranchers, Chewing Gum, Suckers, and the Gummy Bears.
 He needs to see how much inventor is on the shelf before restocking to make sure that he does not go over the 60 piece 
 limit.
